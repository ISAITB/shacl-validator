    localisedName: Interoperability Test Bed - SHACL validator
    shortDescription: Customisable web application for the validation of RDF data
      via various APIs.
    longDescription: >-
      The Interoperability Test Bed's SHACL validator is a web application for the
      validation of RDF data against SHACL shapes. It supports a web user interface,
      as well as SOAP and REST APIs for machine-to-machine integration. It can also
      be (re)used as the implementation of a validation step in GITB TDL test cases,
      the executable test cases used in the Interoperability Test Bed for conformance
      testing. The validator is fully configuration-driven allowing its customisation
      for the needs of specific projects and organisations, ranging from the
      configuration of supported types of validation to its look  and feel. 

      The validator is supported by the European Commission's DIGIT which also
      provides hosting for eligible public validators on its cloud
      infrastructure. In such a case, operation is managed by DIGIT but the
      validator's configuration and updates remain fully under the control of
      its owner. Alternatively, the validator can also be self-hosted by using
      its public Docker image and providing it with the project's specific
      configuration.
